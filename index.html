                    I am a UX Practitioner passionate about solving problems. I'm good at digging in to find the root of a problem and figuring out the best way to solve it. I make thoughtful, well-researched decisions in my designs, and I love creating great, accessible experiences for everyone. 
                    I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a degree in Computer Science and Interactive Media. 
                    <br /><br />
                    When not designing, I enjoy baking, nordic skiing, boxing, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/az.calligraphy">practicing my calligraphy</a>.</h3>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">edX</p>
                            <h4>The Problem &amp; the Goal</h4>
                            <p>The edX Help Center needed a new information architecture, as well as a design facelift. The goal of this project was to assess the information in the Help Center, and to redesign it to surface more frequently asked questions, so that it could be a place where people with questions could quickly and easily find answers.</p>
                            <img style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/help_center_desktop_hifi.png" alt="Help Center redesign proposal"><p class="caption">Help Center redesign proposal</p>
                            <h4>Research</h4>
                            <p>I started off by doing landscape analysis and noting what features of other help centers I thought would work. Features I thought were particularly helpful included a "Quick Links" section on the home page and "Related Articles" on individual article pages. I also did a card sort of some of our current help center topics to see where users would categorize them.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                            <p>I explored several different landing pages for the help center. I eventually settled on the frequently asked questions and categories of other articles, with a large search bar and button to submit a question.</p>

                            </div>
                            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                            <p>The usability tests were successful overall. After the tests I made the slight change of moving the “view all topics” link to below the popular topics, because some people were confused about what the topics they were looking at were when the “all topics” link was above them. Users had good task completion rates. One suggestion we got was to take everything except the search bar and frequently asked questions away, and leave that as the landing page, which could be an interesting exploration as well. </p>
                            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                            <p>I hope that this new help center will hopefully continue to deflect tickets and provide clearer and better service for edX users.</p>

                            <h2>Course About Pages</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">edX</p>
                            <h4>The Problem &amp; the Goals</h4>
                            <p>The course about pages had high bounce rates. They are information-dense, and users often land directly from Google and have a hard time orienting themselves. The goals of this project were to make the information more digestible, creating a more lightweight page, and also provide more information about edX - all in order to ultimately decrease bounce rates.</p>
                            <img style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/about_page_hifi.png" alt="A higher fidelity prototype of an about page design idea"><p class="caption">One of the higher fidelity designs that we tested with new content, as well.</p>
                            <h4>Research</h4>
                            <p>We started by doing some cross-functional team sketching, and then iterating on each other’s sketches. I also looked at other online educational competitor’s sites. I liked the 100% width pages that most other competitors had, as well as some of the other features they brought to the page, such as detailed course outline. I then took these sketches from the cross-functional team and ideas from other sites and made some low-fidelity designs to test. </p>
                            <img style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/about_page_wall.jpg" alt="Sketches of about page design ideas"><p class="caption">Sketches we made with the cross-functional team</p>
                            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                            <p>I designed and tested a lot of variations for a new about page, most of them mobile. I tested ideas like a tabbed layout on mobile to make the page shorter, having related or recommended courses on the page, having a course outline, examples of problem sets or quizzes, and more. On desktop I tested having a 100% full width page, with and without an accordion layout to consolidate the information. I tried new sections like a course outline, the edX Mission and how learners can help, and an overview of the features the LMS contains - like videos and interactive quizzes. </p>
                            <div class="row-2">

                            </div>
                            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                            <p>The usability testing was very positive overall. On mobile there was still some confusion around what the user had landed on, so I added a “course” label to the title of the course. There was also confusion around the “Support a Learner” messaging - users were confused about what they were paying for - did they get the course or did someone else get the course? In later prototypes, I changed this messaging to the edX Mission with options on how to help support it, which was clearer. Users really liked the tabbed view and the recommended courses, as well as seeing an outline and example course material.</p>
                            <h4>Takeaways &amp; Next Steps</h4>
                            <p>The about page is a place where improvements could make a big difference for edX. Hopefully with a clearer and more lightweight design, the bounce rates will be lower and the course engagement will go up, because learners will be able to successfully choose the right course for them from the get-go. If I could take this project further, I would’ve liked to test a few more designs, perhaps showing a few in one test to see which one performed the highest. The next steps for the about page would be A/B Testing with our current about page and hopefully seeing bounce rates go down. </p>

                            <h2>Master's Degrees</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">edX</p>
                            <h4>The Problem &amp; Goal</h4>
                            <p>edX launched fully online Master's Degrees in the fall of 2018. In order to prepare for this launch, the UX team was tasked with designing a landing page to give users enough information to feel confident reaching out to get more information about the degree. edX had been running one online Master's degree as a beta, so it was that page that we started with.</p>
                            <div class="row-1">
                                <div class="column-1"><img style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/gt_original_masters_page.png" alt="The original Master's Degree landing page design"><p class="caption">The original Master's Degree landing page design</p>

                            </div>
                            <h4>Research</h4>
                            <p>The old page was text heavy and didn't contain what we felt to be the most important information. Through usability research, we discovered that when potential students look for Master's degrees, they want to know how much it costs, what the outcomes are, how long it will take, and if it's going to be worth their time and energy (from surveys and usability testing). <br /> Our main challenge was to make sure the information on the page was digestible, but still enough information to help people make a decision. Another challenge was making sure people understood the difference between edX and the school providing the degree &mdash; edX is the platform, but the degree still comes from the school providing the program and is equivalent to the on-campus degree. </p>
                            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                            <p>The page went through several iterations that we ran usability tests on, as well as collecting stakeholder feedback. We came to a page that has a lot of information, but is readable and sectioned in a way that it makes it convenient for the user to peruse on their own time, coming back to and finding the information they are looking for while they make their decision. The sticky menu helps the page feel easier to navigate. The primary and secondary actions (applying to the program and contacting the university to learn more about applying, respectively) are always accessible as well. </p>
                            <img style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/masters_live.png" alt="Current Master's Degree landing page design"><p class="caption">Example of a current Master's degree landing page</p>
                            <h4>Takeaways &amp; Next Steps</h4>
                            <p>In future versions of this page, I would like to explore a more outcome-based page. Making more specific curriculum information available is another aspect of the page that I think is important to continue developing, as well as perhaps case studies of successful capstone projects or even testimonials of students that have gone through the program.</p>

                            <p>In Interaction Design, we spent a large part of the semester developing our own interactive application.  The application had to be responsive and it had to track something.  As a busy college student, I chose to create an application that would help track time in categories.  My application, Check, is a to-do list where students can plan their days and see a chart of how their time is being spent.
                            As someone who plans her days down to the minute sometimes, I really felt that this interface was something I needed and would use.  The class took us through all the stages of designing an application.  We had to consider the users, create personas and scenarios, wireframe our application and test it with real users.

                            <h4>The Problem &amp; Goal</h4>
                            <p>The administrative dashboard for edX for Business customers allows whatever administrator is overseeing company training and professional development to view statistics on what employees are taking what courses and how those employees are doing. It also allows administrators to assign coupons to their employees in bulk, which lets their employees take courses on edX at a discounted rate, or even for free. I designed the coupon management system from the ground up, and worked side-by-side with the engineering team to have it built. The problem is that this page didn't exist previously, so I didn't know exactly what users were looking for or how they were going to use this page. So while anything would have made this process easier than what was the current manual state, it was challenging to build something net new, and we still have much to learn about usage and customer behavior.</p>

                            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                            <p>After mapping out all the user flows I could think of for this experience, I realized that what made the most sense was to highlight the few bulk actions that would be the most commonly performed, and to design the experience around that. I did some landscape analysis on table design, mostly to figure out filtering and action items. The designs went through several iterations and critiques with the entire UX team before we had a page that was reasonable for the number of action and complexity that existed on the page. </p>

                            <h4>Research</h4>
                            <p>Testing such a complex experience unmoderated was not easy. Most of the tests were successful, although many users said things along the lines of "I'm sure this would be easy to use with some training", which wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear. However, by watching the actions they tried to take and noting the order they tried things I did learn a lot about what made sense on the page. </p>

                            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                            <p>Designing this coupon management experience was one of the most challenging things I've done. Making an incredibly complex set of information and potential actions easy to use was complicated. I don't by any means think this is the best version of what could be done with this experience, but I think that this is the version that allows the myself and the rest of the UX team learn how people are using the product and lets us iterate from it. Automating this process so that it isn't manual and doesn't take employees hours to do is a huge step forward, and continuing to improve edX for Business will exponentially improve edX's value as a company.</p>

                            <p>I have led two Watch &amp; Learns at edX. A Watch and Learn is an event that the UX team puts together several times a year where we show usability tests we have run to other employees of edX. This gives other people at the company more insight into what we are doing and why it's important, as well as opening their eyes to some of the experiences users struggle with on our site. We have showed videos of users trying to find and enroll in courses, of users trying to use the website on a phone, and we recently ran a particularly interesting Watch and Learn about usability tests we ran on competitors' sites. Generally, we show short clips from tests that foster discussion, and the room is always packed!</p>

I have spent hackathons redesigning the entire LMS (learning management system) with the UX team, redesigning the homepage experience to get people to meaningful course content as quickly as possible, and creating various responsive components for the site, like a new responsive dashboard for logged-in learners.</p>

                            create one screen that had all the information that was necessary. Both ads above are different examples of this, where the photo of the truck, map, text, and click-through button all had to fit into a small space. </p>

                            The wave was installed in the art building, and a photograph of it was used as the cover for the College of Arts, Media, and Design's inaugural magazine.</p>
